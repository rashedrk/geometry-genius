        <h3>3. What is event bubble?</h3>
        <p>when we interact with a webpage an event occurs.like- click,mouse enter,mouse out, hover etc.
            <br>
        when an event occurs the DOM try to catch the event. so it reaches to the node where the event occurs. after capturing the event it propagate the event to its parent elements until it reaches the root element.
        this technique is called event bubbling.
        <br>
        <u>For example:</u>
        <br>
        if we click an li inside ul then we can see the ul is also clicked. and the container section also clicked. so the event is propagating.
